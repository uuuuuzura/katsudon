# 🎴 Katsusando
A card site for [Colors TCG](https://colors-tcg.eu/) to display collecting and mastered decks and facillitate trading

Or at least it will be once it's finished

## 📝 Next steps
* Render collected cards in a deck
* Render cards and guidelines on the trading page
* Dynamically populate card count, level and level banner
